To install the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd elewa-website
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:

   npm install
   ```

## Getting Started

After installation, you can start the development server:

- `src/assets` : contains the data needed by the app.
- `public/`: Contains public assets like HTML and images.
